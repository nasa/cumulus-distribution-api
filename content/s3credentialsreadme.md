## Temporary S3 Credentials README

The Cumulus API also provides a convenient documentation page deployed alongside of the `/s3credentials` endpoint.


Un authenticated GET requests return a webpage that describes the basic use of the `/s3credentials` endpoint and displays a small example of how to use the returned credential object.
